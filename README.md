# 🔢 Matrix Operations Tool

## 📌 Overview
This project was developed during my internship at **CodexIntern**.  
It is an **interactive command-line application** built using **Python and NumPy** that allows users to perform various matrix operations with ease.  

Users can input matrices of any size, and the tool provides structured results for operations like **addition, subtraction, multiplication, transpose, and determinant calculation**.

## 🚀 Features
- Input matrices with custom dimensions and elements  
- Perform the following matrix operations:  
  - ➕ **Addition** (A + B)  
  - ➖ **Subtraction** (A - B)  
  - ✖️ **Multiplication** (Dot Product A·B)  
  - 🔄 **Transpose** (Aᵀ)  
  - |A| **Determinant Calculation**  
- Built-in error handling for invalid dimensions and input  
- Interactive menu-driven interface  
- Displays results in a **structured and readable format**

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/Suryansh-101/InternTask-3/blob/main/matrix_tool.py

2. Install required library:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy

3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python matrix_tool.py

---

## 📊 Example Workflow
===== Matrix Operations Tool =====
1. Add Matrices
2. Subtract Matrices
3. Multiply Matrices (Dot Product)
4. Transpose Matrix
5. Calculate Determinant
6. Exit
==================================
Select an option (1-6):

---

Example: Choosing 1 (Addition)

Enter dimensions and elements for Matrix A and Matrix B

If dimensions match → tool outputs Matrix A + Matrix B

Otherwise → shows an error message
